Statistics is a branch of applied mathematics that involves the collection, description, analysis, and inference of conclusions from quantitative data. Two types of statistical methods are used in analyzing data: 
1.     Descriptive statistics 
2.     Inferential statistics.

*Descriptive statistics* help us to make conclusions beyond the data we have analyzed or reach conclusions regarding any hypotheses we might have made. There are 2 types of descriptive statistics:

- Measures of central tendency: used to provide a single value that represents the most typical or common value around which the data points are distributed.
1.     Mean: The arithmetic average of all the values in a dataset.
2.     Median: The middle arithmetic value in a dataset when it is ordered from least to greatest. 
3.     Mode: The value that occurs most frequently in a dataset. Unlike mean and median, mode can be applied to categorical data as well.

- Measures of dispersion or variation: 
1.     Range: Difference between highest and lowest value.
2.     Variance: Measures how far each number in the set is from the mean
3.     Standard deviation: Represents the average spread distance of an observation from the mean
4.     Interquartile range: It is a better measure of dispersion than range because it leaves out the extreme values. It equally divides the distribution into four equal parts called quartiles: 
 i.         First 25% is 1st quartile (Q1) 
 ii.         middle one is the 2nd quartile (Q2) 
 iii.         last one is 3rd quartile (Q3)

Ø Outliers have a disproportionate effect on statistics like mean but don’t affect median, mode and IQR.
